- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a trained urban planner, embarking on this daring journey towards urban computing
- ğŸ‘€ Coming from a non-technical background, this Github is a documentation of my journey in computing
- ğŸŒ± Codes and projects are from self-learning, assignments at my MSc in Computer Science program, and the ALX Software Engineering training.
- ğŸªœ My codes are a work in progress, and they might be less optimized.
- ğŸ”“ So, I am open to re-learning, unlearning, collaborating, and embracing new ideas.
  
- ğŸ“« Please reach me at nicsonwilson@gmail.com.
