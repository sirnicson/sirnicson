- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, I am a trained urban planner, embarking on this daring journey towards urban computing
- ğŸ‘€ Coming from a non-technical background, this Github is a documentation of my journey in computing
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing an MSc in Computer Science, and simultaneously training as part of the ALX Software Engineering Track.
- ğŸªœ My codes are a work in progress, and they might be less optimized.
- ğŸ”“ So I am open to re-learning, unlearning, collaborating, and embracing new approaches.
